**Shield Insurance Company**  is a leading provider of insurance services in India, with a significant presence in other countries as well.

However, the management noticed a lack of actionable insights to make quick and informed decisions. To address this, they aimed to enhance their data analytics capabilities by expanding their team with skilled data analysts.

During my internship at AtliQ Technologies, I worked on this project to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Shield Insurance. This dashboard provides critical insights into customer acquisition, revenue trends, and policy performance, helping the company make data-driven decisions and drive business growth.
